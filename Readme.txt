This project included simple changes to the HTML and CSS docs to do the following:

- Changed title from "Website" to "Horiseon Home"
- check for logical flow in HTML
- Fixed links
- Consolidated CSS classes to shrink CSS code
- Changed some HTML tags to be Semanticaly correct.
- Created alt tags for each image in HTML

Some examples of this work include changeing <div> tags to <header>, <section>, <article>, <aside> and <footer> where appropriate.

Many of the CSS IDs could be consolidated into one class.  Specifically anywhere there where different IDs or Classes with the exact same CSS codes were conslidated to one class.

The HTML links were tested and fixed where needed.

Alt tags were created and tested for each image in the HTML.
